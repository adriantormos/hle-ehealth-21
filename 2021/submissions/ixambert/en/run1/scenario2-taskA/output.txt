Taken together, we conclude that T cells are decreased and exhausted in patients with COVID-19.
The increased lung macrophage population was present in severe COVID-19 patients
Firstly, COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period, which causes a time delay between real dynamic and the dailyobserved case numbers
Implications of all the available evidence: COVID-19 is currently exhibiting sustained transmission in China
The pathological process of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is the inflammation reaction characterized by destruction of deep airway and alveolar
COVID-19 has currently spread to 85 countries and most national authorities have failed to keep it's rapid spread contained
We assumed that it might be related to bystander activation induced by hyper inflammation, or a delayed response to the infection in severe COVID-19
The epidemiological curves of COVID-19 in China showed the progression of illness in the outbreak over time from December 8, 2019 up to February 11, 2020, 11 when there were a total of 72314 confirmed cases as the geo-temporal spread of COVID- 19
Over half (n=30, 56.6%) of the COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac marker levels
In addition to the diagnosis value of Ab test, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titer since 2-week after illness onset, for the first time in COVID-19 patients
In this study, the median age of 116 COVID-19-confirmed patients was 54 years (IQR, 38-69; range 20-95 years), of which 67 (57.8%) were male
None of our cases had severe respiratory illness requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, suggesting it will be rare that patients meeting the definition of a suspected case will require enhanced care, at least while COVID-19 itself remains rare in the UK
Similar to the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS, severity of COVID-19 disease is associated with increased age and/or a comorbidity, although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups
The existing spread of COVID-19 is faster than SARS partially because it has more complicate spread dynamics
COVID-19 is apparently more contagious than SARS and, without protection, people can be easily infected by close contact
Interestingly, there were 24 (45%) COVID-19 patients with elevation in the levels of one or more myocardial enzymes and markers of myocardial damage whose features did not meet the strict definition of myocardial injury, with most of them having the common NCP type and experiencing quick recovery; however, 58.33% of these patients exhibited LV dysfunction on echo, and long-term outcomes should be observed via follow-up in a future study
We demonstrate here that COVID-19 patients have very high levels of serum IL-10 following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also displaying high levels of the PD-1 and Tim-3 exhaustion markers on their T cells, suggesting that IL-10 might be mechanistically responsible
By assuming these rates of early epidemic growth, we estimate that 130 cities in China have ≥50% chance of having a COVID-19 case imported from Wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine
In our survey, we found that although 81.1% of the parents were paying attention to the COVID-19 epidemic and the situation of the CKD itself, only 4.32% planned to adjust the medication dosage based on their previous medical knowledge and experience
As mentioned in previous studies, the severity of lymphocytopenia might indicate the severity of COVID-19, under the assumption of SARS-CoV-2 viral could attack and destroy the lymphocyte targetedly
In a recent analysis, of the 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, only 2.1% were in pediatric patients (≤19 years of age)
Moverever, the levels of elevated ALT and AST are generally not high on admission in our study, indicating the COVID-19 -related liver injury is not serious at the initial stage of infection
Regarding to laboratory tests, consistent with most reports, peripheral lymphocytopenia is the most crucial and common feature for COVID-19 infection
Besides, nearly half of COVID-19 patients may not have fever at admission(6) and the lymphocyte count in patients with heart failure can also be decreased
For a scenario such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, there is unfortunately significant morbidity and mortality, and it is heterogeneously distributed between age groups
The effective reproductive number, R, of COVID-19 in Hubei was in a range of 2.1 to 4.2 in scenarios based on different assumptions and data sources
Different with heart failure, COVID-19 was characterized by an inflammatory pulmonary edema and alveolar damage
Logistic regression analysis indicated that NCP severity was a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients
Other significant parameters, age and meaningful lower respiratory symptoms, were also included into the COVID-19 EWS
A high correlation of blood lymphocytes with the disease progression suggested that lymphocyte deficiency or incapacity is the key cellular pathology of COVID-19
The results also indicate that the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 in a location and life satisfaction depends on individuals' level of exercise, but in a direction opposite to our expectation
As for COVID-19, several studies have described clinical manifestations including respiratory symptoms, myalgia and fatigue
The daily statistics showed that lockdown are effective in reduction of incidence of confirmed cases with COVID-19 after about 11 days in china
Whatever the case, lymphopenia is an indicator of severe COVID-19
However, whether the limited number of pediatric COVID-19 cases is due to less susceptibility or milder presentation leading to missed detection remains unknown
The COVID-19 had been affirmed to have human-to-human transmissibility [3] and has now spread worldwide, which raised high attention not only within China but internationally
The high risk factors of cardiac injury including tachycardia, TnI elevation and low EAT density in CT scan, have been observed in the severe and critical COVID-19 patients
We found statistically significant evidence of positive diversifying selection (~7% of S -gene sites) along the branch leading to COVID-19
In addition, another explanation is that some COVID-19 patients may have a past history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD patients have a proinflammatory milieu and functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations
The levels of PCT, a marker suggesting the bacterial infection, were not elevated in the patients with COVID-19, suggesting the viral-mediated pneumonia rather than bacteria
We conclude that a significant reduction of COVID-19 cases is achievable only through a systematic package consisting of enhanced control measures including self-isolation / self-production , effective quarantine and rapid detection / testing
The true CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province 137 should fall between 0.8% and 0.9%
Greater encouragement from health authorities is needed to assimilate COVID-19-related knowledge among HCWs, including doctors
Interestingly, the numbers of total T cells, CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells are negatively correlated to levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10, respectively (Figure 2B) , suggesting these cytokines promote T cells decrease in COVID-19 patients
Unlike pneumonia caused by other pathogens, COVID-19 has some unique characteristics on the CT scan
These results corresponded to a significantly increased risk of blood group A for COVID-19 with an OR of 1.279 (95% CI Table 1 )
In general, COVID-19 in severe cases progresses rapidly to lethal complications (ARDS, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, refractory metabolic acidosis and so on), even leading to death
According to the CT reports, if a CT scan was COVID-positive, its ground-truth label was 1; otherwise, the label was 0
We next examined 113 patients with COVID-19 from another hospital in Wuhan City, the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and found a similar risk distribution trend of ABO blood groups for the infection
For a given COVID-19 case with symptom onset on the t-th day, the number of secondary cases follows a negative binomial (NB) distribution with a mean at Reff(t) and a dispersion parameter at k
