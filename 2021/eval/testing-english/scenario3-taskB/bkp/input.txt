Moreover, conjunctival congestion and positive RT-PCR in pharyngeal swabs were found at the same time in four COVID-19 patients (cases 11, 20, 23, 24) who reported no eye disease history
The 3D lung mask of an input chest CT volume helped to reduce background information and better detect COVID-19
According to these findings, the fewer the TCR clones, the more severe the COVID-19 condition
In conclusion, we suggest that in a scenario where containment is not possible and it is necessary to allow some infections to occur to achieve population immunity, interventions that protect vulnerable populations from getting infected should be given the highest priority, followed by interventions targeting the general population, and finally those targeting the least vulnerable, which for COVID-19 seem to be children
SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral pathogen of COVID-19 of which the outbreaks resulted in 106,893 confirmed cases involving 3,639 deaths over 103 countries, areas or territories as of 07 March 2020
Other infections may therefore exacerbate COVID-19
A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts
Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia
Other symptoms included shortness of breath, myalgia or arthralgia, sore throat, nasal symptoms and diarrhea ( Blood routine showed that decreased lymphocyte count was present in 38.1% of the COVID-19 patients
As the number of hospitalised COVID-19 cases continues to increase, hospitals will increasingly need to ration limited resources and improve clinical pathways to effectively prioritise patients with greatest clinical need
While RT-PCR-based methods have been widely used in COVID-19 diagnosis, their application in accurate diagnosis of viral infection and epidemic control is severely hampered by their laborious and time-consuming sample processing steps
Importantly, we identified N8R and NLR as powerful prognostic factors for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases
This is critical since COVID-19 infection can rapidly progress from hospital admission to ARDS in as few as 2 days, and COVID-19 infection can be fatal
Consistent with this report, we here also found that the secretion of cytokines including TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-10 was increased in COVID-19 patients
The signal corresponding to ubiquitin was elevated in both wild type and TRIM25 KO cells
Patients who required ICU care just presented 8.65%
Previous studies had shown that SARS-CoV 3a protein can up regulate the expression of fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells
Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-20 PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively
The SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models are suitable for modeling COVID-19 epidemics
People with blood group A have a significantly higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O has a significantly lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups
Conversely, school closures may be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which may lead to greater levels of prevented cases
Approximately 20% of allied health workers believed that the flu vaccine is sufficient for COVID-19 prevention
The COVID-19 spread even shows that persons without any symptoms or clinically negative in infection can still spread it to others
It is believed that the primary transmission mode of COVID-19 is through large respiratory droplets and close contact, although there is limited data that indicates that it may also spread through indirect contact with contaminated environments and aerosols
Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered in COVID-19 strain using the comparative sequencing
Total T cell number was significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients, but no significant difference was observed between mild and severe patients
The further impact of COVID-19 on patients' kidney function, especially the incidence of chronic kidney disease in these patients should be the focus of future research
The COVID-19 virus is able to establish between human-to-human transmission and is currently spreading from Wuhan to many nearby 268 cities and countries
A new study revealed that the reproductive number of COVID-19 is up to 3.28
The CoViD-19 outbreak has become increasingly severe, and no drugs so far have proved capable of stemming the viral growth
Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter
If asymptomatic infections are more persistent than symptomatic ones, the mean generation interval for COVID-19 could be longer than estimated from symptomatic cases alone
The protection, maintenance or promotion of lymphocyte levels might have a good effect on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19
Therefore, temperature screening in the high-risk 56 population is important for early identification of COVID-19 infection and thereby reducing the risk of cross infection
Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
Novel coronaviruses (COVID-19) , which was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019 presents an acute public health threat to the whole world
The prevalence of COVID-19 in cases with CT-confirmed pneumonia sent for 2019-nCoV testing was 23.9% (21/88)
This yields an R0 above 2, comparable to current estimates for COVID-19
Clinical studies conducted on hospitalised cases show that the onset of COVID-19 is associated with symptoms commonly associated with viral pneumonia, most commonly fever, cough/sore throat and myalgia/fatigue
We estimated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 infections to be 4.9 days, which was calculated based on a big sample size with valid data
Social distancing, including school closures, can limit COVID-19 cases
Preventing recognition or blocking the occurrence of inflammatory action, new drugs development on immune regulation, might be new breakthroughs in the control of COVID-19 pneumonia
A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in China in late-December 2019
The confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result by using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) detection for routine nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens
Isolation of cases and contact tracing has been implemented for COVID-19
Although both diseases can have similar GGO and septal thickening, rounded morphology, peripheral distribution and fibrous lesion were relatively specific in COVID-19
COVID-19 is a beta-coronavirus, presenting as viral pneumonia with high infectiousness through respiratory droplets or direct contact and appears to have greater infectivity and a lower-case fatality rate when compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome(MERS)
Usually, COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2-7 days 2 with no obvious 41 symptoms, during which time the virus can spread from infected to uninfected individuals
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2) has caused the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has emerged as a serious public health concern
The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be similar to those of pandemic influenza and will likely facilitate further global spread
